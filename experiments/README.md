## Experiments

### pca vs. best bands
* use SSIM to pick 8 'best' bands that contain as much imformation as possible (maybe KL-divergence is also applicable). Use linear system to solve the mapping relation between 8 and rest bands. Then compare with PCA.

### Entropy.m
* a test of entropy method in parameter selection, which was introduced by Dr. Li Shen _et al_. Seems not very effective in our scenario.
